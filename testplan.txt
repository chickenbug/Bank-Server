Test Plan

Weâ€™ve tested our code using the test cases outlined in bank-testcases.txt using multiple client computers, and with local and remote servers. 
The rationale behind the test cases can be explained as follows:

	Open: Tests for invalid single account open and invalid repeat account open

	Start: Tests for invalid start of nonexistent account, valid start of existing opened account, and wait on account already in session

	Exit: Tests for valid exit command in bank session

	Credit: Tests for valid credit of funds into a valid account

	Debit: Tests for valid withdrawal of funds via debit when funds are present, and invalid withdrawal of funds when insufficient funds are present

	Balance: Tests for valid balance check on an account

	Finish: Tests for valid exit of account session

	Print Bank: Tests for print of bank balance every 20 seconds and print of IN SESSION for accounts that are in session

	Bank Full: Tests for the invalid opening of an account after all 20 accounts are filled

	Connect: Tests to see if client attempts to reconnect with server every 3 seconds upon connection failure

	Sever Killed: Tests for notification messages after the server process for the client exits or is killed

	Invalid Commands: Tests for the warning messages after an invalid command is given
